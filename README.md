## Project Definition

I built a crypto price tracking web app that lets users create a watchlist, view live prices, receive email alerts when prices pass their chosen thresholds, export watchlist data, and view basic price predictions. The system is designed around reliable data ingestion from the CoinDesk API, a secure Supabase Postgres database with RLS policies, and email alerts using the Resend API.

PriceGuard Crypto connects directly to course topics such as Data Collection and Cleaning, Databases, and Machine Learning.
